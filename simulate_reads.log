#quick description of ways to simulate reads


##model 100x reads across the genome (1X but covering whole genome)
#Usage:	shred.sh in=<file> out=<file> length=<number> minlength=<number> overlap=<number>
in=<file>       Input sequences.
out=<file>      Destination of output shreds.
length=500      Desired length of shreds.
minlength=1     Shortest allowed shred.  The last shred of each input sequence may be shorter than desired length.
overlap=0       Amount of overlap between successive reads.
reads=-1        If nonnegative, stop after this many input sequences.
equal=f         Shred each sequence into subsequences of equal size of at most 'length', instead of a fixed size.
median=0        If nonzero, randomly shred reads to a length with this median.
variance=0      If median is nonzero, shred to lengths of median +-variance.


shred.sh in=RAL-799_r6.36.wrapped_coord.masked.fa out=RAL-799_r6.36_R1_1x.fq length=150 overwrite=true

###or normal distribution
#calculate how much coverage is needed
#C=LN/G
#coverage = 150*(959077)/122653977

###now do 1x but not covering the full genome
##check the wgsim man page, there is a lot of different options
conda activate wgsim

wgsim RAL-799_r6.36.wrapped_coord.masked.fa RAL-799_r6.36_R1_1xNormal.fq RAL-799_r6.36_R2_1xNormal.fq -1 150 -2 150 -N 959077 &> RAL-799_r6.36_wgSim_1x.log &

#then after it finishes, remember to gzip the reads so that they dont take so much space

#simulating reads in genomes that are hard masked goes crazy, need to soft masked or not masked
